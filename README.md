    Capture the full depth of your images by including:
       * -b 1: The grayscale band, adding depth and detail.
       * -b 2: The green band, highlighting nature's vibrant hues.
       * -b 3: The blue band, bringing in the cool and calm tones.


  * üíé Pristine Quality - -co QUALITY=100
    - Ensure top-notch clarity by setting the JPEG quality to a perfect 100%. Ideal for when every detail matters and quality cannot be compromised.

  * üìê Custom Size - -outsize 24000 16000
    - Define your canvas with custom dimensions of 24000x16000 pixels. This setting is perfect for capturing intricate details and expansive landscapes alike.

  * üåì Scale Adjustment - scale
    - Fine-tune your images with scale adjustments. Modify the brightness and contrast to suit your artistic vision, bringing a personalized touch to every pixel.

### üöÄ Usage

Unleash the power of image conversion right from your terminal! Here‚Äôs how to get started:
üñ•Ô∏è Running the Script

Fire up the magic with a simple command:

 ``` python tiff_to_jpeg_converter_and_cropper.py ``` 

### üß© User Inputs

* The script will playfully ask you for:

   * TIFF Picture Name: Whisper the name of your TIFF image, ready to be transformed.
   * 3 Band TIFF Image Name: Dream up a name for your soon-to-be-created 3-band TIFF masterpiece.
   * JPEG Name: Conjure a name for the final JPEG image, your digital canvas.

### üé® The Transformation Journey

* Watch as your images undergo a magical metamorphosis:

    * Three-Band Conversion: Using convert_tiff_to_three_band, your TIFF is reborn with three bands (-b 1, -b 1, -b 1), shining in 16-bit unsigned integer glory (-ot UInt16).
    * JPEG Genesis: With convert_tiff_to_jpg, your image leaps into the JPEG realm. We talk 8-bit finesse (-ot Byte), a trio of bands (-b 1, -b 2, -b 3), impeccable quality (-co QUALITY=100), and a scaling adventure (scale factor 65535).
    * Folder Creation: Like a wizard, create_folder summons a new home for your TIFF, a cozy folder bearing its name.
    * Cropping Magic: The crop spell slices your JPEG into perfect 800x800 squares, each finding its place in the newly conjured folder.
    * Timekeeper's Tale: As the dust settles, you‚Äôll see the time, in seconds, it took for this enchanting journey.

### üåü Glorious Output

* Behold the treasures you‚Äôll uncover:

   * A 3-band TIFF image, proudly wearing the name you chose.
   * A JPEG image, radiant and crisp, also named by you.
   * A folder, echoing the name of your TIFF, filled with neatly cropped JPEG squares.



### Note



The script expects the TIFF image to be located in the current working directory. The output files will also be created in the current working directory.
